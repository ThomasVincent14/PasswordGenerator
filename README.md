# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
The motivation behind this project was to provide users with safe and secure passwords to help protect their information and logins. The problem solved is having to come up with a password that may not be the best or strongest option to protect one's information. I learned that javascript is one big calculator that processes and generates multiple variables to give users different possibilites every time.

## Installation
The first steps include making an HTML, CSS and Javascript file. I began the HTML first and titled the document, "Password Generator" and then I began putting in the layout of what I want on the page with the header, body, form, label, input link rel and script properties to help Javascript know what to do. Next I messed around with the CSS and just changed everything to my liking. I do understand that this was a refactoring excercise but I didn't have that much help and had to reference Youtube to get this thing done. Anyways, none of what I used in the CSS was new and it required less CSS than the previous assignment. Next was the fun part which was the Javascript. Some of the key properties I messed around with were the 'const', '.concat' (to combine arrays without changing any existing array), '.addEventListener' and made sure all the elements had somwhere to go.
## Usage
The instruction on how to use this webpage are really easy and simple, all you have to do is click the boxes whether they are symbols, uppercase letters or numbers and you can also toggle the length at which you want the password to be and then boom! You have your very own random and secure password.
## Credits
I used a couple youtube videos and but the one I referenced the most and found most helpful was Web Dev Simplified. He actually took the time to explain to viewers how things worked which was awesome. Here is the link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKo9pDKKHnc
